# Study Group Lecture 16 | Consensus and Gasper

The introductory part of the study group is now over and we are now starting the deeper dive with live sessions from core developers. 

For the first session of this week, we are diving into the consensus mechanism of Ethereum with [Ben Edgington](https://x.com/benjaminion_xyz). Ben is a seasoned core contributor who worked on Teku consensus client, Optimism and is author of Eth2 Book, the annotated specification. 

Watch the presentation recording by [Ben Edgington](https://x.com/benjaminion_xyz) on Youtube. Slides are [available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mSn8JUfY88HvcCauLBkKRuy3f6YFlV9VcJptav0Ef24/edit#slide=id.p).

## Pre-reading

Before starting with the Day 16 content, make yourself familiar with resources in previous weeks, especially day 2 on CL and day 6 on specs (at least the CL part). You should have general understanding of Beacon Chain and different mechanism in Ethereum consensus layer. 

Additionally, you can get ready by studying the following resources.

- Vitalik's [Beacon Chain Fork Choice](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/fork-choice.md) - outdated, but still excellent
- [Consensus chapter](https://eth2book.info/latest/part2/consensus/) in the Upgrading Ethereum book
- [Annotated spec on fork choice](https://eth2book.info/latest/part3/forkchoice/phase0/)
